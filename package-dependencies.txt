// Dependencies you need to install in your React app:

npm install @googlemaps/react-wrapper

// Make sure you also have these (usually already in React apps):
// - react
// - react-dom

// For styling, this component uses Tailwind CSS classes
// If you don't have Tailwind, install it:
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
