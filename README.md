## CleanChain — *Proof of Cleanup on the Blockchain*

> A decentralized platform that lets anyone **clean dirty areas, prove it with geo-tagged evidence, and earn crypto rewards** — all tracked publicly using **Google Maps + Blockchain**.

### Problem Statement

Thousands of people voluntarily clean public spaces — from parks and lakes to beaches and roads — but:

* Their efforts often go **unrecognized and untracked**
* There’s **no trusted proof** that cleanup actually happened
* **No incentives** to motivate new volunteers

Governments can’t solve this alone. But with the right platform, **people can take back control of their communities** — and get rewarded for doing good.

### What CleanChain Does (Solution)

**CleanChain is a Web3-powered “proof-of-cleanup” system**.

It creates a live map of “eco-bounties” — locations that need cleanup. Anyone can:

1. **Claim a site** that needs cleaning
2. **Clean it** and upload geo-tagged, time-stamped photo proof
3. **Get verified** by the community
4. **Earn crypto rewards** and build a public impact profile

All cleanup data is logged on the **blockchain** so it’s tamper-proof, visible to the world, and permanently recorded.
